*Linux system programming File Handling*

/* Linux specific Header file explanation */
1.Additional Header file :
	a.linux specific header file
	b.WSL is available on windows
	c.Some header file can be accessible to wsl but it is specific to linux os only.
	d. we use system level function in Win32 Api. for that calling function required  
	some lib "user32.lib", "gdi32.lib", "kernel32.lib" so same as we have function in linux which we called as system calls. 

2.Dev Enviroment :
	a.Lib c file madhe sagla implemention asta system call kase karyche tyache
	b.Developement enviroment install karto utils , libc , bin_utils, and libc_developement te install kelywar 
	c.Assembler, linker, viewer, objdump install hoto
	d. GCC package ne compiler install hoto.
	e.Symbolic , constant , typedef

3. Library files explnation
	a.#include <errno.h>
		Extern int err_no; define in libc lib file.
	b. Error number variable is number give to the error.
	c System call means its implmented by kernel and call by the applicaton programmer.
	d. *How to see all system call
		/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_64.h ->Linux operating system call

4.System call
	a. System call return integer or void*
		failure int = - 1, void* = NULL;
	b.Libc lib file drive through system call.
	b. When system call get failed os provide the error in global err_no variable it will put the number. 
	if we want to get the error string from that the error strerror(int_err_number) then you can put the reason

5. File Handling system call
	a. When we want to perform some operation on file.
	b. Kenerl should know the meta data of that file.
	c. When we call the open system call kernel locate the meta data of that file inode and get into the kernel address space 
	d. now we dont want to give this file access to everyone so it return integer value if it -1 it mean system called get failed unable to open file.
	e.while closing the file we need to provide that integer number means file description number.
	
6. File Mode
	a. O_RDONLY - Mala he file only read karnysathi open karychi ahe.
	b.	O_WRONLY - Mala he file fkt right karnysathi open karychi ahe.
	c.Advance Flag
		a.	O_NOCTTY
		b.	O_NONBLOCK
		c.	O_ASYNC
		d.	O_DSYNC
		e.	O_EXCL
	d. Open is a variadic system call.
	e.For Open system call these From 3 mode is 1 mod is compulsory 
		a. O_RDONLY
		b. O_WRONLY
		c. O_RDWR
	Additionally, if you provided O_CREATE then third parameter is compulsory. S_I(RWX)
